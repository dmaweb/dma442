# dma442 will get you set up with a basic local development workflow. It installs a self-enclosed, self-running web server with BrowserSync and Sass processing.
To install, download and unzip to your computer, or clone using Terminal or Github desktop.
Open Terminal, and type:

`cd`

Then drag the DMA442 folder onto the Terminal window. The path to your folder will be inserted after cd.

Now type

`npm install`

Wait a few seconds, and when it's all done, type

`npm run gulp`

Now when you make changes to your .html or .scss files, the browser will reload.
